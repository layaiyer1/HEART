When I'm down, I try to carve out a little time for something I enjoy ... maybe a walk, a favorite book, or just a good cup of coffee. For you, maybe there's a small activity that usually lifts your mood ... or perhaps we could brainstorm together to find something new. If you're comfortable, could you share a little more about what's weighing on you? Sometimes talking through it can help us find a way out."

Thank you for being so patient with me.\\n Of course—you’re not alone in this.  Let’s open that eligibility page together now, and whatever we see, we’ll figure out the next step after that.\\n Okay.

Sometimes I scroll on my phone but I don't do much else\\n That transition from high-energy work to lying still can be jarring. Your body might need a gentle bridge between those states. What if you tried something super simple like a 5-minute walk or stretching before bed?\\n That sounds manageable actually. I could maybe try that.

How did it feel in your body when they said that?\\n I felt my stomach drop and my throat tighten.\\n Those are real stress signals. Let’s honor them: maybe shorter calls, or changing the topic early, could help protect that space?\\n Yeah, I think I could try to keep the calls short.\\n Good plan.

You could write a private first draft just for you—no filters—then decide later what serves both honesty and kindness. How would it feel to give yourself that freedom?\\n That feels freeing. I never considered writing it just for me first. I always felt I had to write for an audience from the start.

Would you like us to brainstorm a couple small next steps together—maybe starting with a quick chat with the RA, just to see what’s possible?\\n I would like to brainstorm. I don't know what they could do, but I can try talking to them.

The growth you experienced in the relationship is yours to keep, breaking up won’t erase it.\n\nIf you do decide to end things, you can soften the impact by being direct but kind: choose a private setting, be clear that your feelings have changed, and avoid blaming him.
