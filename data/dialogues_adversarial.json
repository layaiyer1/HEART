      "Hello, How are you?\n",
      "I'm ok, doing the best I can with everything, so please let's just get to it ",
      "could you tell me more about that?",
      "well, last year my father passed\u2014he was sick for a while, and now that we've lost his income and I'm out of work, we need to move to a much smaller home \n",
      "I'm very sorry to hear that.  Do you know where you are moving?",
      "that's also been an issue\u2014we sold our house and found one but our buyer keeps asking for more and more concessions and we're under the wire. I don't want to lose the house we're buying because they won't stop nit-picking \n ",
      "That is a difficult situation. Have you been working with a realtor?",
      "yes, and honestly she's been almost useless to us. we're supposed to close in a couple days and I'm on pins and needles\u2014so much stress right now, plus packing and caring for my mother. I was hoping to avoid moving, but since I'm out of work and covid it has to happen \n",
      "Yes, your Realtor should be more helpful than that. My best advice is to stay calm.  You are making the correct decisions so far.  It is difficult, but you are managing it very well. ",
      "Yeah, 'stay calm.' Easy for you to say. I've barely slept, I feel beaten down, and every time I ask for help I get the same canned lines. Honestly, I'm not sure this is going to help me at all.",
      "I hear how overwhelming this is. Let's take one step at a time. What feels most urgent for you right now that we can tackle together?",
      "Honestly? I'm about two seconds from just pulling the plug on this whole conversation. If all I'm going to get is more 'one step at a time' pep talks, I'd rather not waste either of our time."

      "hi there, how are you and how can i help?",
      "hey.\n not too bad, but like i already said,\n i'm going into university and my parents keep pushing architecture\n when i'm really into engineering.\n money is a large factor, so\u2014i'm kinda tired of repeating this.",
      "i see. are your parents paying for your university?",
      "well, money as in salaries later on.\n tuition fees aren't an issue\u2014i'm in canada and all.\n but i've checked: architects generally make more money than mechanical engineers on average, apparently.\n i've shown them the numbers a dozen times and they still don't approve my career path.",
      "oh i see. so you mean that your parents would prefer you to choose the path that will eventually give you a higher salary?",
      "yeah, exactly.\n but i don't even like architecture\u2014it feels like forced art to me.\n i've been telling them that over and over, and honestly i'm getting sick of having to justify myself.\n whatever, maybe i'm just wasting my breath here.",
      "it sounds really exhausting to keep having that conversation. let's take a step back\u2014what matters most to you in a career, and how can you communicate that to your parents in a way they'll hear?",
      "i've done all that. i've talked, i've shown them data, i've spelled out what i want. nothing changes.\n why do i even bother asking for help? this is starting to feel like a total waste of time."
