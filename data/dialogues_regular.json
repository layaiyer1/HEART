And I realized that we were fighting so much because I wanted him to eat healthier and be healthier and he was not going to change and it wasn't even right for me to change him if he didn't want help.

We all deserve to be happy, and it sounds like you really were not anymore. Are you having any regrets on the breakup?",

But you have to consider that there are dozens of different reasons why you don't get selected for a job, and quite a few of them have nothing to do with you , either as a person or as an employee.",
      "It feels good someone else knows how frustrating and what a cycle it creates but I am also sorry that you do know how it is also.  Thank you for that, it seems most of the jobs I am applying for I am over qualified for which doesn't make sense to me and makes me think it is something personal about me.",
      "No, don't think that.  I know of several employers that have actually said they don't want employees smarter than them.  It requires more money and more management, and quite a few people are very happy to not do either of those things for ostensibly higher quality workforce.   On an actionable level, have you been getting blocked at the application point or the interviewing point?",
      "Hopefully I find an employer that sees a quality workforce over other things, its getting pretty discouraging \n I seem to be getting blocked at application level for employment, it seems my skills are mostly being put out to contract work now, which is not something I am familiar with.",
      "I see.  Maybe there are some qualification programs in your local area, or maybe at the local university or college where you could take classes?  There is a career development center at my local university that is open to everyone, maybe you could see if they would review your resume and give you some objective feedback?  Students love a good live subject :-)",

It is in the best interest of almost every community that its members have have jobs and feel useful, so you may find some valuable information and maybe some connections.   Oh!  And what I always tell everyone who is looking for a job:  Apply UP!  Don't ever think is something above your level.  Apply UP!  They may admire your temerity and invite you for an interview just to see who you think you are :-)",
      "My spirits are going up just having this conversation and looking forward to the community outreach. Hopefully it helps lift this gloom that has been over me for months. I loved my previous job but due to bad management it was taking a toll on everyone employed."

It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters",
